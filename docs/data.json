These 2D images are spatially registered and algorithmically reconstructed into complete 3D volumes, which can be visualized through various rendering techniques (surface, maximum intensity, or realistic rendering). 4D ultrasound adds the temporal dimension by rapidly acquiring sequential 3D volumes (up to 20-30 volumes per second), enabling real-time visualization of dynamic three-dimensional structures. This technology allows clinicians to observe spatial relationships and movement patterns that cannot be fully appreciated with conventional 2D ultrasound.",
