For enhanced control over metadata, Plastimatch can be used with the command plastimatch convert --input my_nifti_file.nii.gz --output-dicom output_folder --prefix image_, ensuring compatibility with clinical imaging systems. Additionally, in MATLAB, the dicomwrite function allows custom conversion by loading a NIfTI file, extracting slices, and saving them as DICOM while preserving metadata.

Since MINC does not natively support DICOM metadata, an intermediate NIfTI conversion is required. The command mnc2nii input.mnc output.nii transforms the MINC file into a research-friendly format, while img2dcm output.nii output.dcm generates a single DICOM file from the NIfTI image. If the dataset contains multiple slices, a batch process is needed to convert the entire volume into a DICOM series, where img2dcm -v --study-from original.dcm output.nii output_series/ ensures that DICOM metadata (such as patient details and imaging parameters) are preserved from an existing reference DICOM file. This ensures data standardization across imaging platforms. Additionally, DCMTK\u2019s dcm2xml output.dcm > metadata.xml allows for validation of metadata, ensuring correct integration into PACS. For batch processing, a shell script can loop through multiple MINC files, automating the conversion for large datasets. The script iterates over all .mnc files in a directory, using mnc2nii to convert each MINC file to NIfTI and img2dcm to convert each NIfTI file to DICOM, saving the final output in a dedicated DICOM folder. This workflow ensures efficient handling of large-scale breast MRI datasets, allowing seamless integration into research and clinical workflows. The tools used\u2014MINC-Toolkit for medical image processing, DCMTK for DICOM conversion, and dcm2xml for metadata verification\u2014enable high-quality image preservation and clinical standardization.

        "content": "Motion Artifacts: Since MRM scans take longer than CT myelography, patient movement can cause motion artifacts, leading to blurring and loss of detail. This is particularly problematic in patients who have difficulty staying still due to pain, neurological disorders, or claustrophobia. Motion correction algorithms or faster sequences can help mitigate this issue. Magnetic Susceptibility Artifacts: Metal implants, such as spinal fixation devices, can distort MR images due to their interaction with the magnetic field. This limits the use of MRM in post-surgical patients who have spinal hardware, as image degradation may make diagnosis difficult. Alternative imaging techniques, like CT myelography, are often recommended in these cases. Long Scan Time: A typical MRM scan takes 20\u201340 minutes, which is significantly longer than CT myelography (~10 minutes). This increases the likelihood of patient discomfort and motion artifacts. Additionally, longer scan times limit throughput in busy clinical settings, making scheduling more challenging. Lower Spatial Resolution Compared to CT Myelography: Although MRM provides excellent soft tissue contrast, its spatial resolution is lower than that of CT myelography, which can achieve ultra-high resolution of sub-millimeter structures. This makes MRM less effective for detecting very fine nerve root abnormalities or subtle CSF leaks. Limited Availability of High-Field MRI Scanners: While 3T MRI scanners improve image quality for MRM, many facilities still rely on 1.5T systems, which may produce lower-resolution images with reduced CSF contrast. Access to 3T or higher MRI scanners is not always available, particularly in smaller hospitals or rural areas."

        "content": "Not Suitable for Patients with Implanted Medical Devices: Patients with pacemakers, defibrillators, cochlear implants, or aneurysm clips may not be eligible for MRM due to the strong magnetic field. Even MRI-compatible implants require safety verification before scanning, limiting patient eligibility. Inferior for Detecting Bone Abnormalities: MRM is optimized for soft tissue visualization (CSF, nerve roots, spinal cord) but is less effective for detailed bone imaging. CT myelography or plain CT scans are preferred for evaluating fractures, bone spurs, or spinal deformities. Gadolinium Contrast Risks (If Used): While MRM is typically performed without contrast, some cases require gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for better visualization. However, GBCA use is limited in patients with kidney disease due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Additionally, recent concerns about gadolinium retention in the brain have led to more cautious use of contrast-enhanced MRI. Claustrophobia and Patient Discomfort: Some patients experience claustrophobia or anxiety inside the MRI scanner, making it difficult to complete the scan. Open MRI machines or mild sedation can help, but these solutions are not always available. Limited Use in Emergency Situations: Due to longer scan times and the need for patient cooperation, MRM is not ideal for emergency cases, such as acute spinal trauma. In such situations, CT myelography or standard MRI is preferred for rapid diagnosis."
