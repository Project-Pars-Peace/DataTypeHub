Dynamic Nature: Proteins\u2019 conformational changes and transient interactions are hard to capture, as most methods provide static snapshots. Size Constraints: NMR is less effective for large proteins (>50 kDa), while cryo-EM, though improving, requires expertise and expensive equipment. Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs): PTMs can alter structures, but their detection and integration into models remain challenging.

Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs): While MS can detect PTMs, it struggles to map their precise structural impact or functional consequences without additional techniques like X-ray crystallography or NMR. Protein Dynamics: MS captures static snapshots, missing dynamic structural shifts (e.g., allosteric changes) critical to biological function. Complex Assemblies: Inferring quaternary structure or protein-protein interactions is indirect, relying on crosslinking or co-detection, which may not fully resolve native configurations. Sequence-to-Structure Ambiguity: Peptide-level data from MS can\u2019t always distinguish between isoforms or structurally similar proteins, complicating structural assignments. Denaturation Bias: Sample preparation (e.g., denaturation for MS) disrupts native structures, restricting inferences to primary sequence rather than higher-order organization."
