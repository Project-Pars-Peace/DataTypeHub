It works by first quantifying these molecules using technologies like RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), mass spectrometry, or microarrays, which generate raw data reflecting their abundance. These data are then normalized to account for technical variations (e.g., sequencing depth or batch effects) and subjected to statistical models\u2014such as t-tests, ANOVA, or more advanced methods like DESeq2 or edgeR\u2014that calculate differential expression by comparing expression levels between groups, assigning p-values and fold-changes to determine significance and magnitude of differences.
