    "shortDescription": "A medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to produce real-time, moving images of internal structures, such as organs and bones, on a fluorescent screen. It allows doctors to observe the movement and function of internal body parts, such as the digestive system, blood vessels, and joints, to diagnose and treat various medical conditions.",
    "imagingPrinciple": "Fluoroscopy is a real-time imaging technique that uses X-rays to produce continuous images of internal structures in motion. The principle involves an X-ray beam passing through the body and striking a detector, such as an image intensifier or flat-panel detector, which converts X-ray photons into visible images. These images are displayed on a monitor, allowing dynamic assessment of physiological processes like swallowing, joint movement, or catheter guidance. Fluoroscopy often uses contrast agents to enhance visualization of soft tissues and blood vessels. Due to continuous X-ray exposure, dose optimization techniques, such as pulsed fluoroscopy and dose-limiting settings, are crucial to minimize radiation exposure to patients and healthcare providers.",
