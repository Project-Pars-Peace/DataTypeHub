These limitations include: 1. **Alignment Errors**: Misalignments due to sequencing errors or incorrect reference genomes can lead to false conclusions about gene content, structural variations, or evolutionary relationships. 2. **Incomplete Coverage**: Areas of the genome, particularly repetitive or low-complexity regions, may be poorly aligned or missed, limiting the ability to study these regions' biological significance. 3. **Reference Bias**: Alignment to a reference genome may introduce bias, as differences in genetic diversity between the sample and the reference can lead to misalignments and inaccurate variant calls. 4. **Inconsistent Alignment Quality**: The quality of alignment can vary depending on sequencing technology and read length, which can affect the accuracy of downstream analyses such as variant calling and functional annotation. 5. **Limited Functional Insight**: Sequence alignment provides valuable structural information, but without functional data such as expression profiles or proteomics, it\u2019s difficult to infer the biological role of specific sequences or variations. 6. **Over-Interpretation**: Drawing conclusions from alignment data without experimental validation or integration with other omics data can lead to incorrect biological interpretations. In summary, while sequence alignment is a powerful tool for understanding genetic relationships and variation, its limitations in coverage, accuracy, and functional interpretation must be considered in biological research."
