Built with Python as its core language, the solution leverages several powerful tools including pip for dependency management, Docker for containerization, SimpleITK for image processing, and highdicom for DICOM manipulation. The tool features a straightforward command-line interface that allows users to specify DICOM modality types during conversion (such as MR for MRI scans). For flexible deployment, nii2dcm is available both as a pip-installable package and as a pre-built Docker container. The project is actively developed with support for additional imaging modalities planned for future releases, making it a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working with medical imaging data.",

Begin by installing spec2nii via Conda (conda install -c conda-forge spec2nii) or pip (pip install spec2nii). Once installed, run the conversion command spec2nii philips SDAT_FILE SPAR_FILE, replacing SDAT_FILE and SPAR_FILE with the appropriate file paths for your data.

The -m flag specifies whether you're converting a .2dseq (for multi-dimensional 2D data) or .fid (for 1D data) file. You can also use the -d option to dump the header files (such as method and acqp for .fid, or visu_pars for .2dseq) into the header extension.

You will need to provide an optional affine matrix file (a 4x4 matrix that contains the orientation data), which can be specified using the -a argument.
