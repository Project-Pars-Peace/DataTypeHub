Built with Python as its core language, the solution leverages several powerful tools including pip for dependency management, Docker for containerization, SimpleITK for image processing, and highdicom for DICOM manipulation. The tool features a straightforward command-line interface that allows users to specify DICOM modality types during conversion (such as MR for MRI scans). For flexible deployment, nii2dcm is available both as a pip-installable package and as a pre-built Docker container. The project is actively developed with support for additional imaging modalities planned for future releases, making it a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working with medical imaging data.",

The tool incorporates intelligent error correction for the known \"image offcentre\" bug in V4 PAR/REC images, ensuring accurate spatial orientation in the converted files. Written primarily in C/C++, dcm2niix PARREC employs several key tools including the NIfTI library for format handling, command-line interface components for user interaction, file manipulation libraries for reading PAR/REC files, and header parsing utilities to extract crucial metadata. The solution offers flexible file naming options through argument strings and placeholders, though it has limitations with interrupted scan datasets, for which users are directed to alternative tools like dicm2nii.",

Additionally, FSL provides specialized orientation tools (fslreorient2std, fslcpgeom, fslorient, fslswapdim) that ensure proper spatial alignment of brain images according to standard neuroanatomical conventions. Written primarily in C++ with Python interfaces, FSL integrates multiple computational libraries including NIfTI I/O libraries, matrix calculation tools, statistical packages, and optimization algorithms to deliver a powerful platform for neuroscientific research that maintains compatibility with major neuroimaging data formats.",

Developed by Andrew Janke, this lightweight converter is implemented primarily as a Perl script that methodically translates the spatial and metadata elements from MINC's scientific format into the clinically standardized DICOM structure. The toolset includes the core mnc2dcm converter script alongside supporting utilities like dcmdump and dcmsort for DICOM file manipulation and organization. The solution employs several fundamental technologies: Perl as the programming language, MINC library for reading the source format, DICOM toolkit for constructing valid medical images, element hashing algorithms for metadata mapping, and slice processing routines for proper 3D to 2D conversion. With command-line options for verbosity control, version information, help documentation, and dry-run capabilities, mnc2dcm serves as a critical bridge between research and clinical neuroimaging workflows.",
