Sample Complexity: Biological samples contain thousands of proteins with varying properties, making complete proteome coverage difficult. Ion Suppression: In complex mixtures, certain ions may suppress others, reducing detection accuracy and reproducibility. Quantification: Accurate protein quantification remains challenging due to issues with ionization efficiency and peptide detection consistency. Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs): Identifying and localizing PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation) is difficult due to their low abundance and the need for specialized enrichment techniques. Data Analysis: The vast amount of MS data requires sophisticated bioinformatics tools, and incomplete databases or errors can lead to misidentification. Instrumentation Limits: Resolution, mass accuracy, and throughput depend on the instrument, with high-end systems being costly and less accessible."

Dynamic Range: Biological samples have a vast dynamic range of protein concentrations (up to 10^10), while MS typically spans a narrower range (10^4\u201310^6), leading to incomplete profiling. Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs): Identifying and quantifying PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation) is challenging due to their low stoichiometry, transient nature, and the need for specialized enrichment methods. Protein Inference Problem: MS identifies peptides, not intact proteins. Assigning peptides to specific protein isoforms or paralogs can be ambiguous, especially in species with high sequence homology. Quantification Accuracy: While techniques like label-free, SILAC, or iTRAQ improve quantification, issues like ion suppression, incomplete labeling, or variability in sample preparation can skew results. Biological Context: MS data provides a snapshot, not a functional narrative. Inferring protein interactions, activity, or cellular roles requires integration with other data (e.g., transcriptomics), which may not align perfectly due to post-transcriptional regulation. Sample Complexity: Complex samples (e.g., tissues, biofluids) may require extensive fractionation, risking protein loss or artifacts, and still may not fully resolve all components."
