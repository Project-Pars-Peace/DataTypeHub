    "title": "Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS)",
    "acronyms": ["CEUS"],
    "shortDescription": " A medical imaging technique that uses ultrasound technology along with a contrast agent (microbubbles) to produce detailed images of blood flow and tissue vascularity. CEUS enhances the visibility of blood vessels, tumors, and other lesions, allowing for improved diagnosis and characterization of various diseases, such as liver, kidney, and vascular disorders.",
    "imagingPrinciple": "CEUS utilizes microbubble contrast agents to enhance the backscatter of ultrasound waves, improving the visualization of blood flow and vascular structures. The microbubbles resonate with the ultrasound waves, creating a strong acoustic signal that enhances contrast in real-time imaging.",
