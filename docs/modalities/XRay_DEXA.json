    "shortDescription": "A non-invasive medical imaging test that uses X-rays to measure bone mineral density (BMD) and assess bone health. It's commonly used to diagnose osteoporosis, monitor bone loss, and evaluate the risk of fractures.",
    "imagingPrinciple": "Dual‐energy X‐ray Absorptiometry employs two low‐dose X‐ray beams at distinct energy levels. Because soft tissue and bone attenuate X‐rays differently at these energies, the system mathematically subtracts the soft tissue component from the overall attenuation, isolating the bone mineral signal. This yields quantitative measurements of areal bone mineral density (BMD) and—when whole‐body scans are acquired—provides additional body composition data (i.e., fat mass and lean soft tissue).",
