Built with Python as its core language, the solution leverages several powerful tools including pip for dependency management, Docker for containerization, SimpleITK for image processing, and highdicom for DICOM manipulation. The tool features a straightforward command-line interface that allows users to specify DICOM modality types during conversion (such as MR for MRI scans). For flexible deployment, nii2dcm is available both as a pip-installable package and as a pre-built Docker container. The project is actively developed with support for additional imaging modalities planned for future releases, making it a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working with medical imaging data.",

The toolset includes the core mnc2dcm converter script alongside supporting utilities like dcmdump and dcmsort for DICOM file manipulation and organization. The solution employs several fundamental technologies: Perl as the programming language, MINC library for reading the source format, DICOM toolkit for constructing valid medical images, element hashing algorithms for metadata mapping, and slice processing routines for proper 3D to 2D conversion. With command-line options for verbosity control, version information, help documentation, and dry-run capabilities, mnc2dcm serves as a critical bridge between research and clinical neuroimaging workflows.",
