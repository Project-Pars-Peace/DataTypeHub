It works by extracting RNA from a sample and converting it into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcription. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, are then used to sequence the cDNA, producing millions of short reads. These reads are mapped to a reference genome or transcriptome using alignment tools like STAR or HISAT2. The mapped data is quantified to determine the abundance of each gene transcript, with further analysis identifying differential expression between conditions. The underlying technology leverages the ability to capture the diversity of RNA transcripts, with computational tools processing the data to provide insights into gene regulation, cellular responses, and disease mechanisms."

SAM/BAM files store aligned sequencing reads in a text (SAM) or binary (BAM) format, with each read's position, sequence, quality, and other attributes like mapping information. Count matrices store numerical data representing gene expression levels, with rows representing genes and columns representing different samples or conditions. This data is usually stored in tabular form, often as CSV or TSV files, where each entry indicates the number of reads aligned to a particular gene in a given sample.

Anonymization and de-identification techniques should be applied to reduce privacy risks, particularly when sharing data for research. Secure storage options, including encrypted cloud storage or on-premise systems with physical and digital security protocols, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, help protect data from unauthorized access. Adherence to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA is essential to ensure compliance with privacy laws. Data minimization practices, along with regular backups, are necessary to reduce risks of data loss.
