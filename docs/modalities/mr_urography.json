One approach is using dcm2nii, an older version of dcm2niix, which allows conversion by running the command dcm2nii -4 my_nifti_file.nii.gz, generating a series of DICOM (.dcm) files. For enhanced control over metadata, Plastimatch can be used with the command plastimatch convert --input my_nifti_file.nii.gz --output-dicom output_folder --prefix image_, ensuring compatibility with clinical imaging systems. Additionally, in MATLAB, the dicomwrite function allows custom conversion by loading a NIfTI file, extracting slices, and saving them as DICOM while preserving metadata. Since dcm2niix itself does not directly support NIfTI to DICOM, these alternative methods provide efficient conversion solutions for integrating research data into clinical workflows.",

Lossless Compression Methods: Purpose: Reduce file size without any loss of original image data, ensuring that all diagnostic details are preserved.\u200b Techniques: Run-Length Encoding (RLE): Encodes consecutive identical pixels as a single value and count. Huffman Coding: Uses variable-length codes for encoding symbols based on their frequencies. Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Coding: Builds a dictionary of substrings encountered in the data stream. Application: These methods are often applied to medical images where any loss of information is unacceptable. \u200b 2. Lossy Compression Methods: Purpose: Achieve higher compression ratios by allowing some loss of image data, acceptable in scenarios where perfect accuracy is not critical.\u200b Techniques: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): Transforms image data into frequency components, discarding less significant ones. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT): Decomposes images into different frequency subbands, enabling multi-resolution analysis. Fractal Compression: Utilizes self-similar patterns within the image for compression. Application: Used when storage limitations necessitate reduced file sizes, and slight loss of detail is acceptable. \u200b 3. Region-of-Interest (ROI) Compression: Purpose: Prioritize the compression quality of diagnostically significant regions while applying higher compression to less important areas.\u200b Technique: Combines lossless compression for the ROI with lossy compression for the background.\u200b Application: Ensures critical diagnostic information is retained with high fidelity, optimizing storage efficiency. \u200b 4. Advanced Transform-Based Methods: Burrows\u2013Wheeler Transform (BWT): Description: Rearranges data to improve the efficiency of subsequent compression algorithms. Application: Enhances compression performance for medical images, outperforming traditional methods like JPEG 2000 in certain scenarios. Mojette Transform: Description: A discrete transform used for image representation and compression. Application: Applied in medical imaging for efficient data encoding and transmission. 5. Learning-Based Compression Methods: Purpose: Utilize deep learning techniques to model complex patterns in medical images for improved compression efficiency.\u200b Techniques: Gated Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks: Capture inter-slice dependencies in volumetric images for lossless compression. Knowledge Distillation: Enhances multi-data medical image compression by transferring knowledge from complex models to simpler ones. Application: Achieve superior compression ratios while maintaining image quality, facilitating efficient storage and transmission. "
