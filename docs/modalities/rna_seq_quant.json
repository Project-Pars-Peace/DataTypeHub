High computational demands arise from the large volume of data generated, requiring significant storage and processing power for alignment, normalization, and downstream analysis.

These include: 1. **Incomplete or Bias in Transcriptome Representation**: RNA-Seq data may not capture all transcripts, particularly lowly expressed genes or those with complex isoforms, which can lead to incomplete or biased gene expression profiles. 2. **Technical Noise and Errors**: RNA-Seq is prone to technical errors such as sequencing bias, adapter contamination, and amplification artifacts, which can introduce noise into the data and affect downstream analysis. 3. **Difficulty in Detecting Low-Expressed Genes**: Genes with low expression levels may not be detected accurately, leading to an incomplete picture of the transcriptome. 4. **Reference Genome Dependence**: The reliance on a reference genome or transcriptome can limit the discovery of novel genes or splice variants, particularly for species without a well-annotated genome. 5. **Interpretation of Differential Expression**: Differences in gene expression may not always reflect biological significance, as variations in expression can be influenced by multiple factors, including sample quality, sequencing depth, and batch effects. 6. **Lack of Functional Context**: RNA-Seq data alone does not provide direct functional information about the genes, and without complementary data (e.g., proteomics, phenotypic data), the biological relevance of expression changes can be difficult to interpret. 7. **Context Dependence**: Gene expression patterns can vary significantly depending on the biological context (e.g., tissue type, developmental stage, environmental conditions), making it difficult to generalize findings across different studies or conditions. In summary, while RNA-Seq is a powerful tool for studying gene expression, its limitations in completeness, accuracy, and context must be carefully considered when interpreting the data biologically."
